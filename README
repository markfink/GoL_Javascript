I currently work for Kuehne &amp; Nagel. We do agile development and follow "Clean Code". They invited me to take part on a company sponsored code retreat last Saturday. So I stayed the weekend in Hamburg to hone my programming skills and to spend more time with my new coworkers. Thanks for the great opportunity!

Here some background info on the code retreat format:

I never took a deeper look into Conways Game of Live before so I was astonished about how much complexity can emerge from such a small set of simple rules (think fractals).

We did TDD and pair programming with focus on different aspects. Something I wanted to get going was to do TDD Javascript development. We used JsTestDriver for that and figured out how to do it.

On rule of a code retreat is to start each 45 min round from scratch with a new partner. So we could not finish the exercise. So for today I planned to complete the exercise with a running version.
